### What is Framework

A framework is a set of conceptual structure and guidelines, used to build something useful. As a programmer, you donâ€™t need to start from scratch when you have tools designed to help you with your projects. Frameworks are software that is developed and used by developers to build applications.

```text
Finally a framework is may include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input,
manage hardware devices, and interact with system software.
```

**Why use framework**:

1. Collection of tools
2. No need to start from scratch
3. Save time
4. Improve productivity
5. Clean code
6. Reuseable code
7. Testing
8. Debugging

### What is Web Framework

A `Web Framework` (WF) or `Web Application Framework` which helps to build web applications.

- Laravel
- Codeigniter

### Model View Template (MVT)

`MVT` is a design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components **Model**, **View**, **Template**

`Model`: The model responsible to handle database. It is a data access layer which handles the data.

`View`: The use can send request by interacting with **template**, the view handles these requests and sends to **model** then get appropriate response from **model**, sends response to template.

`Template`: It represents how data should be presented to the application user. User can read or write data from the template.

  - Process GET/POST
  - Get data from the User
  - Get data from the Model
  - Pass data to Template
- **Model**:
  - Process Data
  - Insert/Update DB
  - Communicate with View
- **Template**:
  - User Interface
  - HTML/CSS
  - Get data from View

### Install Django in Virtual Environment and Create Django Project

```console
root@admin: ~$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.1

root@admin: ~$ django-admin --version
.... Install or not? ...

# create virtual env first
# install django
root@admin: ~$ pip install django
```

**Django Project**: A Django project may  contain multiple project **application**, which means a group of application and files is called as Django project.

> An application is a part of Django project.

**Demo**:

- SchoolProject
  - Registration App
  - Fees App
  - Exam App
  - Attendance App
  - Result App

**Create and Django Project**:

```console
# Syntax
# django-admin startproject project_name
# example
root@admin: ~$ django-admin startproject schoolproject

# go inside the schoolproject
root@admin: ~$ cd schoolproject
root@admin: ~$ ls
manage.py*  schoolproject/

# run django project
root@admin: ~$ python manage.py runserver
